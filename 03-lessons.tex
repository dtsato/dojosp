\section{Lessons Learned}\label{sec:lessons_learned}

Starting is always a problem. It is hard to choose what should be done
first and what should be done later. Problems even raise when choosing
what should not be done at all. Since the sessions are being held, the
authors could identify what practices and rules went well (Subsection
\ref{ssub:well}) but also found out that some things work less well
(\ref{ssub:less_well}) than expected. Finally, applying the practice
to different audiences and in different contexts, the authors
discovered some unaddressed issues (\ref{ssub:puzzles}).
