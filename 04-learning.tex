Collaboration and Self-Organization
Creating and sharing knowledge
No single Master

One of the attendees joined the sessions just at the beginning when he
had just finished his first semester in Computer Science. He is now on
his third semester and most of his works are done using TDD no matter
what language is being used. His latest work involved implementing
sparse matrixes with common operations in C. He decided alone to do it
using TDD with a testing library implemented during a \textit{Coding
  Dojo} session (\cite{Dojo31}). It resulted into an amazingly clear
code with full test coverage. His ability to identify and pin down the
required tests to force the correct implementation far surpass his
collegues'. He has shown us strong evidences that the knowledge and
practices adopted during the \textit{Coding Dojo} can be absorved and
understood regardless of experience on the matter. It also shows that
the informal, non-directed and non-rigid format proposed can be very
effective and supportive to more traditional teaching methods.
