\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This report shares the experiences of running a \emph{Coding Dojo} at
the University of São Paulo and, more recently, at ThoughtWorks. The
process and roles used to conduct the meetings were improved through
retrospectives based on the participants' feedback. By sharing the
lessons learned from this experience, the authors expect that this
learning tool can be applied to different contexts, encouraging more
people to start their own \emph{Coding Dojos}. Finally, the role of a
\emph{Coding Dojo} in the learning process was discussed, showing how
students at different skill levels can use deliberate practice to
improve and share knowledge with a wider group.
