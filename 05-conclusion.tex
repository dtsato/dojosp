\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This report shares the experiences of running a \emph{Coding Dojo} at the University of SÃ£o Paulo and, more
recently, at ThoughtWorks. The process and roles used to conduct the meetings were improved through
retrospectives based on the participants' feedback. By sharing the lessons learned from this experience, the
authors expect that this learning tool can be applied to different contexts, encouraging more people to
start their own \emph{Coding Dojos}. Finally, the role of a \emph{Coding Dojo} in the learning process
was discussed, showing how students at different skill levels can use deliberate practice to improve and to
share knowledge with a wider group.
